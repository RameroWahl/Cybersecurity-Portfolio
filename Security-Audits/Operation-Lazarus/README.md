# 🛡️ Operation Lazarus - Red Team Breach Simulation

## 📜 Overview
Operation Lazarus is part of a simulated **Red Team Security Audit** designed to evaluate network vulnerabilities, privilege escalation paths, and data exfiltration risks.

✅ *Purpose:* To showcase advanced adversarial techniques in a controlled environment.  
✅ *Outcome:* Full compromise, Project Lazarus AI prototype extraction, database loot, and total log wiping.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Compromise perimeter defenses.
- Demonstrate chained exploits leading to root access.
- Persist via cron job modifications.
- Exfiltrate **high-value AI prototype and database records**.
- Evade detection by cleansing logs and bash history.

## 🛠️ Techniques Used
| Tactic                    | Technique Description                                      |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reconnaissance**        | Nmap scanning, vulnerability discovery                     |
| **Initial Access**        | Apache CVE-2021-41773 exploitation                         |
| **Lateral Movement**      | SSH key harvesting, password spraying                      |
| **Privilege Escalation**  | Cron job poisoning, `/tmp` abuse                           |
| **Persistence**           | Cron job reverse shell injection                          |
| **Exfiltration**          | SCP Lazarus AI model and database dump                     |
| **Cleanup**               | Log clearing, history wipe                                 |

## 🧠 Loot Captured
- ✅ **Project Lazarus AI Model**
- ✅ **Full MySQL Database Dump**
- ✅ **SSH Private Keys**
- ✅ **Leaked User Passwords**

---

## 📚 Key Takeaways
- **Cron Jobs** remain a critical but overlooked privilege escalation vector.
- **Weak password reuse** provides easy lateral movement.
- **Layered persistence** guarantees re-entry even if caught.
- **Proper patch management** (Apache versioning) is non-negotiable.
