# ðŸ“œ Security Audits â€” Cybersecurity Portfolio

**Overview**  
This section contains simulated security audits, penetration tests, and red-team exercises designed to showcase real-world attack simulations, defensive review processes, and incident handling. Each audit is self-contained and intended to demonstrate both offensive technique and practical defensive remediation.
